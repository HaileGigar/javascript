There are 3 types of functions in javascript: regular functions +  function expressions and the fat arrow functions.

function config(cpu, ram, speed){
         console.log(`this ${cpu} is an hp computer with ram ${ram} gb and an average speed of ${speed}.`
}


let config=function(cpu, ram, speed){
         console.log(`this ${cpu} is an hp computer with ram ${ram} gb and an average speed of ${speed}.`
};


let config=(cpu, ram, speed)=>{
         console.log(`this ${cpu} is an hp computer with ram ${ram} gb and an average speed of ${speed}.`
}

Another most important point  to bear in mind is that even classes injavascript are functions.
