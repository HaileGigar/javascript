There are 3 types of functions in javascript: regular functions +  function expressions and the fat arrow functions.

function config(cpu, ram, speed){
         console.log(`this ${cpu} is an hp computer with ram ${ram} gb and an average speed of ${speed}.`
}


let config=function(cpu, ram, speed){
         console.log(`this ${cpu} is an hp computer with ram ${ram} gb and an average speed of ${speed}.`
};


let config=(cpu, ram, speed)=>{
         console.log(`this ${cpu} is an hp computer with ram ${ram} gb and an average speed of ${speed}.`
}

Another most important point  to bear in mind is that even classes injavascript are functions.

both functions and classes(functions) are objects in javascript- an object means something that has properties and methods to do some activities on the properties (attributes and values)

One of the most important javascript front-end library is React.


after completing the core javascript, I will go to React.

aws lambda function and the elastic beanstalk.

never forget Django and Bootstrap though!
we can perform Django activities in the aws lambda function while the bootstrap front-end activity is more of application deployment which may be done at elaaaastic beanstalk.
